# Dot Files Manager 

This repo is here to help me keep track of my config files and to be able to implement them as needed. This is just how I am setting them up for now. I plan on implementing some features that allow this to be less of a storage of static files but a configuration manager for my basic configs.

## TOC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Configuration Files
   - Git Files
     - config: The files for basic cmd config for the git command line tool
     - pre-commit: This is the pre-commit that will run. I currently have some basic scripts in there running but no pre-commit hooks. will add in the future
